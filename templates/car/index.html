                A body check of a car focuses on evaluating the structural and cosmetic condition of the vehicle's bodywork to detect issues such as previous damage, poor repairs, rust, or hidden problems.

                Online car checks using the VIN code are an essential tool for buyers, sellers, and car owners to verify the history, condition, and legal status of a vehicle. The VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) is a unique 17-character code assigned to every vehicle at the time of manufacture. It serves as a fingerprint, providing essential information about the carâ€™s background, including its manufacturer, model, year of production, and history.
